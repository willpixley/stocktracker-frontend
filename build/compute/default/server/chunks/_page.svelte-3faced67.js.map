Congressional\n\t\t\tcommittees oversee specific industries, giving members access to non-public information that\n\t\t\tcould influence stock prices. If a lawmaker trades a stock in a sector that falls under their\n\t\t\tcommittee’s jurisdiction, the trade is flagged as a potential conflict of interest. This\n\t\t\tallows for greater transparency and helps identify trades that may warrant further scrutiny.</p> <br> <p>Members of Congress have access to sensitive information through their committee work,\n\t\t\tincluding upcoming regulations, industry developments, and government contracts. This\n\t\t\tprivileged access creates opportunities for insider trading, where lawmakers could use\n\t\t\tnon-public knowledge to make profitable trades before the information becomes public. By\n\t\t\tmonitoring these trades, this system helps highlight patterns and potential ethical concerns\n\t\t\tin congressional stock activity.</p></div> `;\n  TradeList($$payload, { trades });\n  $$payload.out += `<!----></div>`;\n  bind_props($$props, { data });\n  pop();\n}\nexport {\n  _page as default\n};\n"],"names":[],"mappings":";;;;;;AAEA,SAAS,KAAK,CAAC,SAAS,EAAE,OAAO,EAAE;AACnC,EAAE,IAAI,EAAE,CAAC;AACT,EAAE,IAAI,IAAI,GAAG,OAAO,CAAC,MAAM,CAAC,CAAC;AAC7B,EAAE,MAAM,MAAM,GAAG,IAAI,CAAC,MAAM,CAAC;AAC7B,EAAE,SAAS,CAAC,GAAG,IAAI,CAAC;AACpB;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA;AACA,8CAA8C,CAAC,CAAC;AAChD,EAAE,SAAS,CAAC,SAAS,EAAE,EAAE,MAAM,EAAE,CAAC,CAAC;AACnC,EAAE,SAAS,CAAC,GAAG,IAAI,CAAC,aAAa,CAAC,CAAC;AACnC,EAAE,UAAU,CAAC,OAAO,EAAE,EAAE,IAAI,EAAE,CAAC,CAAC;AAChC,EAAE,GAAG,EAAE,CAAC;AACR;;;;"}
