			committee’s jurisdiction, the trade is flagged as a potential conflict of interest. This
			allows for greater transparency and helps identify trades that may warrant further scrutiny.</p> <br/> <p>Members of Congress have access to sensitive information through their committee work,

			monitoring these trades, this system helps highlight patterns and potential ethical concerns
